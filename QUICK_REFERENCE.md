# Quick Reference - Lesson Completion Persistence

## ✅ Feature Complete

Lesson completion now persists across page reloads.

---

## How It Works (3-Step Process)

### 1️⃣ User Marks Lesson Complete

```
LessonViewer.jsx → Click "Mark Complete"
  → completeLesson(courseId, lessonId)  [local UI]
  → recordLessonCompletion(...)          [save to DB]
  → addPointsToUser(...)                 [add points]
```

### 2️⃣ Data Saved to Supabase

```
progress table: {
  lesson_id: "1-1-1",      ◄── KEY
  course_id: "1",
  user_id: "user-123",
  points_earned: 10,
  completed_at: "2024-01-15T..."
}
```

### 3️⃣ On Page Reload (New!)

```
CourseContext useEffect([user])
  → getCourseProgress(user.id, courseId)
  → Reads progress table
  → Creates Set of completed lesson IDs
  → Maps lessons: isCompleted = true/false
  → Components re-render with completion status ✅
```

## Code Snippets

### The Core Change (CourseContext useEffect)

```javascript
// NEW: Fetch progress for each enrolled course
if (courseWithEnrollment.isEnrolled) {
  const { success, progress: progressData } =
    await getCourseProgress(user.id, course.id);

  if (success && progressData && progressData.length > 0) {
    // NEW: Create set of completed lesson IDs
    const completedLessonIds = new Set(
      progressData.map(p => p.lesson_id)
    );

    // NEW: Mark lessons as completed
    return {
      ...courseWithEnrollment,
      modules: courseWithEnrollment.modules.map(module => ({
        ...module,
        lessons: (module.lessons || []).map(lesson => ({
          ...lesson,
          isCompleted: completedLessonIds.has(lesson.id)  ◄── KEY
        }))
      }))
    };
  }
}
```

## Testing

### ✅ Quick Test (2 minutes)

1. Login to app
2. Enroll in a course
3. Click "Mark Complete" on a lesson
4. See green "Completed" badge ✅
5. Reload page (F5)
6. Badge still there ✅

### ✅ Full Test Suite

See **VERIFICATION_GUIDE.md** for comprehensive tests

## Debug Checklist

If lesson doesn't show as completed after reload:

- [ ] Are you logged in?
- [ ] Are you enrolled in the course?
- [ ] Did the lesson mark complete before reload?
- [ ] Check browser console for errors
- [ ] Check Supabase: `SELECT * FROM progress`
- [ ] Verify lesson_id in DB matches lesson.id in app

## What Each Component Does

| Component       | Does What                        |
| --------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `LessonViewer`  | Handles "Mark Complete" button   |
| `CourseContext` | Loads progress from DB (**NEW**) |
| `LessonCard`    | Shows completion badge           |
| `Dashboard`     | Displays completed count         |

---

## Performance Impact

- **Load Time**: +100-500ms (depends on # of enrolled courses)
- **API Calls**: 1 per enrolled course (parallelized)
- **Memory**: Minimal (stored in React Context)

---

## Known Limitations

- ⚠️ Doesn't update in real-time (need to reload for others' completions)
- ⚠️ No validation that user actually read the content
- ⚠️ Can't undo completion (feature request?)
