### 9. Data Verification (Supabase)

After completing above tests, verify in Supabase:

**users table:**
```sql
SELECT id, full_name, username, total_points, current_level, wallet_address
FROM users
WHERE username = 'johndoe';
```
Expected: Points increasing, level correct, wallet set

**enrollments table:**
```sql
SELECT user_id, course_id, enrolled_at
FROM enrollments
WHERE user_id = (SELECT id FROM users WHERE username = 'johndoe');
```
Expected: 1 row for Web Development Basics

**progress table:**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as lessons_completed, MAX(updated_at) as last_completed
FROM progress
WHERE user_id = (SELECT id FROM users WHERE username = 'johndoe');
```
Expected: 50+ lessons

**token_claims table:**
```sql
SELECT level, amount, claimed_at
FROM token_claims
WHERE user_id = (SELECT id FROM users WHERE username = 'johndoe');
```
Expected: Rows for each level claimed

### 10. Known Limitations (MVP)

- [ ] Assignments not yet implemented (only lesson completion tracked)
- [ ] Peer review system not available
- [ ] Blockchain NFT minting shows "Coming Soon"
- [ ] Admin sync button not implemented (use Edge Function directly)
- [ ] Discussion forum not integrated with new UI
- [ ] Wallet connection is manual (no MetaMask integration yet)

## Debugging Tips

### Issue: Lessons not loading
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify GitHub repo is accessible
- Check courseUtils.js `fetchLessonMarkdown()` function
- Ensure course.json has correct filePath for lessons

### Issue: Points not updating
- Open browser DevTools â†’ Network tab
- Check POST to `/recordLessonCompletion` call
- Verify Supabase RLS policies allow user update

### Issue: Level not updating
- Check Supabase: `SELECT floor(total_points / 500) + 1 AS level`
- Verify calculation in UserContext.jsx `addPoints()` function
- Check notification trigger in LessonViewerNew.jsx

### Issue: Enrollments fail
- Check if user_id is correctly retrieved from context
- Verify Supabase RLS policy on enrollments table
- Check GitHub token rate limits (if many enrolls in short time)

## Success Criteria

âœ… All tests pass
âœ… No console errors
âœ… Data persists correctly in Supabase
âœ… User can complete full flow: signup â†’ learn â†’ earn â†’ claim
âœ… Points and levels calculate correctly
âœ… Notifications appear at appropriate times

## Next Steps

Once testing complete:
1. Deploy to production (Vercel recommended)
2. Create admin panel for course management
3. Implement assignment submission system
4. Add peer review functionality
5. Integrate blockchain for NFT minting
6. Set up GitHub Actions for automated course sync
