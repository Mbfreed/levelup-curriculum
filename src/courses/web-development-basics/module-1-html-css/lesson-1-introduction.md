# Introduction to Web Development

## What is Web Development?

Web development is the process of building websites and web applications. It involves creating the visual elements that users see and interact with (frontend) and the server-side logic that powers the website (backend).

- **Role**: Defines what elements exist on the page
- **Example**: Headers, paragraphs, images, links

### 2. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)

- **Purpose**: Presentation and styling
- **Role**: Defines how elements look and are positioned
- **Example**: Colors, fonts, layouts, animations

### 3. JavaScript

- **Purpose**: Behavior and interactivity
- **Role**: Makes web pages dynamic and interactive
- **Example**: Form validation, animations, API calls
