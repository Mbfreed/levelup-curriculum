# JavaScript Variables and Data Types

Variables store data values. JavaScript supports different data types like strings, numbers, and booleans.

**Topics Covered:**
- Declaring variables (let, const)
- Primitive data types
- Basic operations

**Example:**
```js
let age = 25;
const name = "Ada";
console.log(name + " is " + age + " years old");
```
