# ✅ Lesson Completion Persistence - Feature Complete

> **Problem Solved**: "i have marked some lessons as completed before but that is not showing"

## What Changed

Lessons marked as complete now persist across page reloads. The system automatically loads your completion status from the database when the app starts.

## How to Use It

Just use it normally - mark lessons complete as usual. Your completions will be saved and will show even after you reload the page.

```
1. Mark lesson complete → Shows green badge
2. Reload page → Badge is still there ✅
```

## Implementation Status

- ✅ Code complete
- ✅ Tested and working
- ✅ Fully documented
- ✅ Ready to deploy

## Quick Test

1. Login to app
2. Enroll in a course
3. Mark any lesson as complete
4. Reload page (F5)
5. Completion badge should still be visible ✅
