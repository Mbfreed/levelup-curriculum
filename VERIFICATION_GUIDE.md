# Lesson Completion Persistence - Verification Guide

## What Was Implemented

The system now persists lesson completion status across page reloads by:

1. **On App Load** (`CourseContext.jsx` useEffect):

   - Loads courses from local JSON files
   - For authenticated users, fetches enrollments from `enrollments` table
   - For each enrolled course, calls `getCourseProgress(userId, courseId)`
   - Creates a Set of completed lesson IDs from the progress data
   - Maps through each lesson and marks `isCompleted: true` if in the Set

2. **On Lesson Completion** (`LessonViewer.jsx` handleMarkComplete):

   - Updates local state via `completeLesson()` (optimistic UI update)
   - Calls `recordLessonCompletion()` to save to `progress` table
   - Calls `addPointsToUser()` to add points to `users.total_points`
   - Both Supabase operations include lesson_id

3. **Display** (`LessonCard.jsx`):
   - Checks `lesson.isCompleted` flag
   - Shows green "Completed" badge with checkmark if true

## Manual Testing Steps

### Test 1: Basic Completion Persistence

**Goal:** Verify that marking a lesson complete persists after page reload

1. **Prerequisite**: Be logged in and enrolled in a course
2. **Steps**:
   - Navigate to a lesson that shows as incomplete
   - Click "Mark Complete" button
   - Wait for toast notification (if implemented)
   - Verify lesson card shows "Completed" badge with checkmark
   - Refresh the page (F5 or Cmd+R)
   - Verify lesson still shows "Completed" badge
3. **Expected Result**: ✅ Lesson remains marked as complete after reload
4. **If Failed**:
   - Open browser DevTools → Console
   - Check for errors in getCourseProgress() call
   - Verify progress table has the lesson_id record

### Test 2: Multiple Lessons

**Goal:** Verify multiple lesson completions persist together

1. **Steps**:
   - Mark 3 different lessons as complete (in same course)
   - Reload page
   - Verify all 3 still show as complete
2. **Expected Result**: ✅ All 3 lessons remain completed

### Test 3: Across Courses

**Goal:** Verify completion persists across different enrolled courses

1. **Steps**:
   - Enroll in 2 courses
   - Complete 1 lesson in course A, 2 lessons in course B
   - Reload page
   - Verify all 3 completions persist across both courses
2. **Expected Result**: ✅ Completions persist correctly per course

### Test 4: Points Accumulation

**Goal:** Verify points are awarded and persist

1. **Steps**:
   - Note current total points (visible in Dashboard or Profile)
   - Complete a lesson (10 points)
   - Check that total points increased by 10
   - Reload page
   - Verify total points still show the higher value
2. **Expected Result**: ✅ Points increase and persist

### Test 5: Fresh Enrollment

**Goal:** Verify system works correctly when enrolling in a new course

1. **Steps**:
   - Enroll in a course for the first time
   - Complete 1 lesson in this course
   - Reload page
   - Verify lesson shows as complete
   - Verify course appears in "Enrolled Courses"
2. **Expected Result**: ✅ Newly enrolled course shows completions correctly

## Browser Console Debugging

If tests fail, check these console logs:

```javascript
// Add to CourseContext.jsx useEffect (temporary debug):
console.log("Courses loaded:", loadedCourses);
console.log("Enrollments:", enrollments);
console.log("Progress for course X:", progressData);
console.log("Completed lesson IDs:", completedLessonIds);
console.log("Final courses with completion:", finalCourses);
```

**What to look for**:

- ❌ Error fetching enrollments? → Check database connection
- ❌ Error fetching progress? → Check getCourseProgress function
- ❌ Empty progress array? → Check if progress table has records
- ❌ Lesson IDs don't match? → Compare progress[].lesson_id format with lesson.id format

## Database Query Verification

To manually verify data in Supabase:

```sql
-- Check enrolled courses for user
SELECT * FROM enrollments WHERE user_id = 'USER_ID';

-- Check lesson completions for user in specific course
SELECT lesson_id, points_earned, completed_at
FROM progress
WHERE user_id = 'USER_ID' AND course_id = 'COURSE_ID';

-- Check user's total points
SELECT total_points, current_level
FROM users
WHERE id = 'USER_ID';
```

## Performance Considerations

- **Initial Load**: getCourseProgress called once per enrolled course (lazy evaluation)
- **Memory**: Course state with completion data is kept in React Context
- **Network**: One API call per enrolled course on app load (optimizable with batch query)

## Potential Future Optimizations

1. **Batch Progress Fetching**: Fetch all progress for all enrolled courses in one query
2. **Caching**: Cache progress data to reduce API calls
3. **Real-time Updates**: Use Supabase subscriptions to sync completion in real-time
4. **Sync on Blur**: Periodically sync completion status to catch any missed updates

## Integration with Other Features

**Level-Up Notifications** (Next Feature):

- After completion + points awarded, check if `new_level > old_level`
- Show toast notification with level-up message
- Call `progressService.claimTokens()` to create token_claims record

**Dashboard Refresh** (Next Feature):

- After lesson completion, user points increase in database
- Need to refetch profile to update displayed points
- Could also re-run level calculation and show level-up animation

## Success Criteria (All Must Pass)

- ✅ Lesson completion persists after page reload
- ✅ Multiple lesson completions work correctly
- ✅ Points accumulation works correctly
- ✅ Points persist after reload
- ✅ Completion status correct across multiple courses
- ✅ No console errors during load or completion
- ✅ No blank/undefined lesson states
